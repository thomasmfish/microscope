Python's microscope package is a free and open source framework for:

* control of local and remote microscope devices
* aggregation of microscope devices into complex microscopes
* automate microscope experiments

It is aimed at those that are building their own microscopes or need
programmatic control for microscope experiments.

This package does *not* provide a graphical user interface that a
typical microscope user would expect.  Instead, it provides the
foundation over which such interfaces can be built.  For a microscope
graphical user interface, consider the sister project `microscope
cockpit <https://github.com/MicronOxford/cockpit>`_.

Microscope is distributed as a source distribution in `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/microscope>`_ and can be easily
installed with `pip`::

    pip install microscope

Alternatively, the development sources are also available on `github
<https://github.com/MicronOxford/microscope.git>`_.
