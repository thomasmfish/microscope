Project History
***************

Over several years we have been involved in building a number of
bespoke optical setups.  A number of these have been in collaboration
with John Sedat and his group at UCSF.  They developed Cockpit, a easy
to drive microscope front end written in Python.

We have done extensive work adding additional hardware support, bug
fixing, and improving the front end.  The system has grown beyond its
design assumptions and we are therefore trying to start again to have
a more sustainable code base for the future.

While a new version implementation of cockpit is being developed
elsewhere, Microscope is the package that Cockpit needs so it can be
only the GUI.
