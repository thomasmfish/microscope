The following is a summary of the user-visible changes for each of
python-microscope releases.

Version 0.3.0 (yyyy/mm/dd)
--------------------------

* Backwards incompatible changes:

  * `microscope.device()`, function used create a device definition,
    changed signature.  The arguments to the device constructor must
    now be passed as a dict.

* Python 3.5 or later is now required.  Python 2 is no longer
  supported.  This drops the dependency on the six and enum34.

* `CoboltLaser` now has a default value for its `baud` argument.

* `LaserDevice.set_power_mw` now clips the set value to the device
  actual range.  Previously, the behaviour was undefined.

* Added Device server support for Windows services.

* DataDevices now handle a stack of clients to receive data.

* New abstract methods:

  * `LaserDevice.get_min_power_mw`
  * `LaserDevice.is_alive`

  * TriggerType
  * TriggerMode

* New hardware supported:
